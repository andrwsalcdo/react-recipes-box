### Takeways 

- Using SASS, React-Bootstrap, and Styled Components probably added a degree of complexity that wasn't needed, but that's okay. I wanted to get a feel for various methods. 

- Thinking about a particular directory structure was not so easy. 

- Functional components are way too much fun!
